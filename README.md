# Using React with Zea Engine

This is the result of the following tutorial: [Using React Tutorial](https://docs.zea.live/zea-engine/Tutorials/react/react)

This repo contains a minimal example of using React with Zea Engine.  <br>
React is used to manage the HTMLCanvas, tree view, and the layout of the React components with Zea Engine's viewport.  <br>
This tutorial also covers how to populate the tree view with data from the scene, and how to pass data from the tree view to the engine.  <br>

This repo uses 'deni-react-treeview' but a custom solution is recommended for your own projects.  <br>

## Dependencies used

yarn add @zeainc/zea-engine <br>
yarn add react-reflex <br>
yarn add sass <br>
yarn add deni-react-treeview <br>
